**GPS Module Interfacing with ATmega328P - Embedded Systems Project**
This repository contains an embedded systems project that focuses on interfacing a GPS module with the ATmega328P microcontroller. The project enables electronic devices to track their location accurately using longitude and latitude coordinates. GPS modules have wide-ranging applications, including vehicle tracking systems, GPS clocks, accident detection alert systems, traffic navigation, and surveillance systems.
**Project Overview**
The primary objective of this project is to interface a GPS module with the ATmega328P microcontroller. By integrating GPS functionality into electronic devices, the project enables the retrieval of essential location-specific information such as altitude, latitude, longitude, and UTC time. The ATmega328P microcontroller serves as the central processing unit, responsible for reading data from the GPS module and performing the necessary operations.

**GPS Module Features**
**Location tracking:** The GPS module receives signals from multiple satellites and utilizes the data to determine the device's precise location.
**Coordinate retrieval:** The module provides longitude and latitude coordinates, allowing accurate positioning of the electronic device.
**Time synchronization:** The GPS module includes UTC time information, enabling synchronization with global time standards.

**ATmega328P Microcontroller**
The ATmega328P microcontroller acts as the interface between the GPS module and the electronic device. Its key functions include:

**Data acquisition:** The microcontroller reads data transmitted by the GPS module.
**Processing:** The ATmega328P processes the received data, extracting relevant information such as coordinates and UTC time.
**Integration:** The microcontroller integrates the GPS functionality into the overall system, enabling location-based features.
